PERN stack project being deployed on a Raspberry Pi 4 running Ubuntu Server 20.04 :D

This is a brand new project that I'm uploading here as material for my portfolio.

A local PostgreSQL service must be active on the machine you wish to execute this project on.

The script sql/database.sql will create a database and the single table currently required.

Update db.js to match the credentials you choose for your setup.

.../blog$ node server.js
.../blog/client$ npm run start

serving at localhost:8080

**I will be updating this repo as often as possible**
